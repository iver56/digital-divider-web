Digital Divider is a math game which is easy to learn, but difficult to master.
Floating numbers cross the screen, and your job is to put them in the appropriate area before they reach the end of the screen. This is a test for both mind and dexterity. Can you beat your friends' highscores in this extremely addictive game?

Digital Divider was created during a Microsoft Hackathon in Norway. Also, it was one of the finalists in the international game competition Dream.Build.Play 2012.
